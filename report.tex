\section*{Problem 1} 
Assume that $L$ is a regular language. Strings $w$ of language $L$ are constructed according to the specification where zero, one or several $a$'s and zero, one or several $b$s are mixed freely as long as there are more $b$'s than $a$'s in it. Let's have a look at such a generic string and how it can be split into three parts $xyz$ such that $xy$ is shorter than $m$, $x$ is $1$ or larger and all $xy^{i}z$ are part of $L$ for all $i \in \mathbb{N}$. Independent of how $m$ is chosen, if $y$ contains more $a$'s than $b$'s, which according to the language definition is possible,  the resulting strings for $xy^{i}z$ $i \in \mathbb{N}$  are for large enough $i$ no longer part of $L$. Hence, proven by contradiction, $L$ can not be a regular language. 

\section*{Problem 2}
Assume that $L$ is a regular language. Strings $w$ of language $L$ are constructed according to the specification as $a^n$ with $n$ being a prime number equal or larger than $2$. For every prime $n$, there has to be a number $m$ which is smaller than $n$, and that multiplied with any natural number plus the difference $n - m$ will be a prime. Such a number does not exist. Hence, L can not be a regular language. 
 

\section*{Problem 3}
Conversion of context free grammar into Chomsky normal form:

First Rule 1 is applied;

\begin{flalign*}
  &S \rightarrow aAB\\
  &A \rightarrow aAa\\
  &A \rightarrow bb\\
  &B \rightarrow a \\
\end{flalign*}

\begin{flalign*}
  &S_0 \rightarrow aAB\\
  &S \rightarrow aAB\\
  &A \rightarrow aAa | bb\\
  &B \rightarrow a\\
\end{flalign*}

No application for the epsilon and unit rule. The last shown steps are according rule four:

\begin{flalign*}
  &S_0 \rightarrow BAB\\
  &S \rightarrow BAB\\
  &A \rightarrow BAB | bb\\
  &B \rightarrow a\\
\end{flalign*}

\begin{flalign*}
  &S_0 \rightarrow BU\\
  &S \rightarrow BU\\
  &A \rightarrow BU | bb\\
  &U \rightarrow AB\\
\end{flalign*}

\begin{flalign*}
  &S_0 \rightarrow BU\\
  &S \rightarrow BU\\
  &A \rightarrow BU | bb\\
  &U \rightarrow AB\\
  &V \rightarrow b\\
\end{flalign*}

\section*{Problem 4}
Proving that the resulting Language $Ls$ from shuffeling the regular languages $L1$ and $L2$ is also regular was attempted here by construction.

The idea is to construct a NFA from NFA/DFA's that accept $L1$ and $L2$. Let's assume The wordlength of $L1$ and $L2$ is $|w1|$ and $|w2|$, hence the NFA/DFA to accept $L1$ or $L2$ will have $u_{1} \ldots u_{|w1|}$ respectively $v_{1} \ldots v_{|w2|}$ states. Now, for example state u1 is split into $|w1|$ substates to `remember' how many states of NFA 2 already have been passed. The same is done for all states of the NFA 1 and 2. Hence the new NFA will in this case have 18 + 2 states (18 + start and accepted end state). All inbound transitions are the same as in the initial NFA's. Hence it has been proven by construction of a new NFA that the shuffle of $L1$ and $L2$ is also a regular language.

The solution is shown in figure 1 produced with graphviz. Figure 2 shows a hand draft of the same figure, but with a more clear grouping.
